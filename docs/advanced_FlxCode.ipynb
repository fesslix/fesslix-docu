    "       \n",
    "   The definition of an object starts always with the name of the object and ends always with a semicolon ``;`` (see also :type:`FlxObject`). \n",
    "   Besides that, strict rules for the syntax of objects do not exist and, theoretically, each object can have its own syntax. \n",
    "   However, most objects require first the definition of obligatory parameters and last the specification of optional parameters.\n",

    "   The definition of an object can go over more than a single line. \n",

    "   The :ref:`const-variables <content:FlxFunction:const>` ``lc1``, ``lc2``, ``lc3`` are treated as local:\n",
    "   If their value changes within the specified `code-block`, the changes are reverted after ``{FLXCODE}`` is executed. \n",
